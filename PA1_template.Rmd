## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
activity <-read.csv('activity.csv')
aggSteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, sum, na.rm =TRUE)
summary(aggSteps)    
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
###1. Histogram of total number of steps taken
```{r}
hist(aggSteps$steps)
```

##2. Mean and Median total number of steps take per day
```{r}
mean(aggSteps$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(x = aggSteps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)

```
- The mean total is `10766.19` steps per day
- The median total is `10765` steps

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Inputing missing values
